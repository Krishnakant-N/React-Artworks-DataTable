# Artworks Gallery Application

This project is a React-based web application that fetches and displays a paginated list of artworks using the [Art Institute of Chicago API](https://api.artic.edu/docs/). It provides interactive features like selecting specific rows, selecting all rows on the current page, and navigating through paginated data.

## Features

1. **Pagination**: Navigate through artwork data using a paginated table.
2. **Lazy Loading**: Data is fetched only for the currently visible page to optimize performance.
3. **Row Selection**: Select individual rows or a specified number of rows across pages.
4. **Select All on Page**: Easily select all rows displayed on the current page.
5. **Customizable UI**: Styled with PrimeReact components and custom inline styles.
